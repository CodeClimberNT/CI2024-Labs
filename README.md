# Computational Intelligence Labs 2024

This repository is used to manage a fast access to all labs during the CI course

## Labs

- [CI2024_lab1](CI2024_lab1/README.md)
- [CI2024_lab2](CI2024_lab2/README.md)
- [CI2024_lab3](CI2024_lab3/README.md)
- [CI2024_lab3F](CI2024_lab3F/README.md)


## Why this repository exist

The course is organized such that each laboratory has its own repository, since I also wanted a single repository where each laboratory was present, instead of copy-pasting submitted lab (and maybe have the problem of different history if a lab was later updated) I used the submodule features of git to track all the laboratory
